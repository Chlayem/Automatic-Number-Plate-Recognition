# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition System

![Demo Animation](demo.gif)

## üåê Project Context 
This project is developed as my end of studies project at **EnterSoft**.

[Smartvisor](https://smartvisor.tn/fr/index.html), the principal product of **EnterSoft**, is a suite of software solutions that centralizes and automates security and surveillance systems.
One of its key components is the ANPR, which leverages computer vision to automatically read vehicle license plates. 

The existing Smartvisor solution primarily targets desktop **Windows** environments and lacks compatibility with **Linux** systems and **Edge Computing** capabilities. 

This project addresses these challenges by proposing a new architecture that enhances the ANPR system's performance and compatibility.



## üõ†Ô∏è Solution
The new architecture introduces a new **web-based approach** built from scratch. 

This solution aligns with **Edge Computer Vision** principles, addressing the critical need for Linux compatibility (a key requirement for most embedded systems).
By processing data closer to the source, the architecture can significantly reduce latency and enhance overall efficiency.

## üöÄ Key Contributions

- **MLOps and Model Integration :**
  - Engaged in MLOps tasks for YOLO models, including annotation and training. Acquired a deep understanding of the YOLO algorithm and the ONNX format, and successfully integrated these models within the .NET environment.

- **Backend Development :**
  - Designed and implemented a comprehensive Web API using ASP.NET Core, guided by Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
- **Video Streaming Solution :**
  - Proposed a tailored solution for video streaming, designed specifically for the new web architecture and capable of managing multiple cameras.
- **Detection Service :**
  - Integrated a detection service capable of handling simultaneous detections, ensuring efficient real-time processing.
- **Frontend Development :**
  - Created a dynamic frontend using React.js to enhance visualisation and user interaction.
- **Testing and Deployment :**
  - Conducted thorough testing and successfully deployed the application on Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.
